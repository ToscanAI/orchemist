# Changelog

All notable changes to Orchemist (formerly Orchestration Engine).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Producer-side 7d sub-checks ported from skills v4.3** (#857) — `templates/coding-pipeline-standard.yaml` bumped to v2.2.0. Additive in the sense that no existing successful run changes — pipelines that produced zero diff-lint candidates continue unchanged. NEW behaviour: IMPLEMENT task step 8 (between commit and push) introduces a new BLOCKED escape category (`7e-seal-diff-lint`) that can halt the pipeline when contiguous-3-line byte-identical added blocks are detected; operators with existing pipelines should be aware this gate can fire on previously-unflagged producer-side duplication patterns. Five new sub-checks across four phases close the caller-enumeration blind spot that let intra-PR byte-identical fragments slip through under the existing 7d (consumer-side) enforcement:
  - **Phase 0 §3a** (existing_symbols_inventory prompt) — pre-existing dual-path helpers inventory (regex heuristic, may have false positives); §5 EXTEND verdict references §3a so EXTEND-ing existing dual-path helpers is the preferred verdict over authoring new ones. Internal version-tag inside the EXTEND verdict updated from skills `v4.3` to engine `v2.2.0` for skills↔engine drift trace fidelity.
  - **SPEC_ADVERSARY 7e** — intra-symbol duplication audit (producer-side variant of 7d). For every newly-created exported symbol, the adversary checks SPEC §B.4 Implementation Steps for byte-identical sub-blocks within the symbol's own body; flags `[divergence] F.X — intra-symbol duplication` without (a) shared-helper extraction or (b) §B.5.x divergence justification.
  - **IMPLEMENT 7e-implement** (HARD RULE) — self-check at authoring time. Before writing a new exported function, inspect return/throw arms for byte-identical-modulo-whitespace duplicates; refactor inline OR return `BLOCKED: 7e-intra-symbol-duplication`.
  - **IMPLEMENT 7e-seal** (HARD RULE + task step 8 between commit and push) — pure static grep diff lint over the feature-branch diff. Single-line candidates accepted with rationale; contiguous-3-line failure gate fires `BLOCKED: 7e-seal-diff-lint`.
  - **REVIEW 7d-producer** — intra-symbol return-arm comparison. REVIEWER quotes each return/throw arm verbatim in `review.md` and flags `[MAJOR][correctness] intra-symbol dual-path duplication` when two arms are identical modulo whitespace/identifiers; §B.5.x divergence-justification short-circuit available with concreteness bar.

  Defense-in-depth across the producer-side variant: 7d catches "new symbol duplicates EXISTING symbol" (consumer); 7e catches "intra-symbol arms duplicate each other" at SPEC, IMPLEMENT (self-check + diff lint), and REVIEW. Ported from `orchemist-skills` PR #8 (commit `66727a0`), which closed skills#6 with empirical anchor in ToscanAI/value-investing#449 lift commit `11db4eb`.

### Changed
- **`spec_adversary` phase bumped to `model_tier: opus`** (#887) — `templates/coding-pipeline-standard.yaml` line 425 changed from `sonnet` to `opus`, completing VISION pillar 8 (max-effort adversary + review phases use opus). Closes the half-honored "cross-model adversary at the spec boundary" promise — the marquee trust-engine wedge now uses opus for BOTH the adversary gate AND the review gate. Cost impact: each spec round now invokes opus at the adversary step in addition to opus at the review step, roughly **2× the per-run opus token cost vs prior baseline** (spec → behavioral → spec_adversary loop can iterate up to 3 times before exhausted). The frozen-state sentinel `tests/test_phases_endpoint.py::test_only_review_is_opus_today` has been updated to expect `{spec_adversary, review}` (method name preserved — the rename was deliberately skipped to keep the diff minimal and the sentinel identifier stable). `templates/coding-pipeline-skip-spec.yaml` is unchanged — the skip-spec pipeline does not include a `spec_adversary` phase (it bypasses the entire spec loop), so the sync invariant from #878 (template drift lint) is satisfied vacuously.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **`docs/RELEASE-SOP.md`** (#837) — formal release procedure addressing risk #1 from the 2026-05-25 strategic audit (PyPI Trusted Publisher trust chain). Documents: maintainer list, pre-release checklist, version-bump PR with 2-reviewer requirement, signed-tag procedure, post-release verification, what's CI-enforced vs honour-system, follow-up hardening backlog, incident-response runbook. Linked from README under Contributing.
- **SQLite WAL backpressure** (#839) — `Database.count_active_pipeline_runs()` counts pipeline_runs in non-terminal states (`pending`, `running`, `pending_review`); `_launch_pipeline_from_trigger` in `web/api.py` checks the count and rejects with `HTTP 429` (`Retry-After: 30`) when it reaches `ORCH_MAX_DAEMONS` (env var, default `8`, set to `0` to disable). Prevents unbounded concurrent daemons from tripping SQLite `SQLITE_BUSY` contention that manifests as zombie runs (#754). Malformed env var falls back to default. 13 regression tests at `tests/test_wal_backpressure.py` covering count-by-status, the 429 path, custom-cap honour, disabled-cap legacy mode, malformed-env-var fallback, and source-wiring guards.
- **SSE connection limits + metrics endpoint** (#841) — new `_SseConnectionLimiter` class (module-scope singleton `_SSE_LIMITER` in `web/api.py`) gates `/api/v1/runs/{run_id}/stream` with per-process counters: `ORCH_SSE_MAX_TOTAL` (default 100) and `ORCH_SSE_MAX_PER_IP` (default 10); set either to `0` to disable. At-or-over-cap returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After: 30`. New `GET /api/v1/sse/metrics` exposes `{active_total, active_per_ip, max_total, max_per_ip}` for ops dashboards + the Admin Console. Limiter is admit/release symmetric: stream handler admits before opening, releases in a `finally` block (any exit path — client disconnect, terminal state, exception). 20 regression tests at `tests/test_sse_connection_limits.py` covering defaults, env honour, malformed env fallback, counter math, per-IP cap, total cap, zero-disabled mode, metrics endpoint, source-wiring guards.
- **`GET /api/v1/phases` endpoint + frontend hydration** (#842) — `web/api.py:list_phases_api` returns the ordered phase list for a pipeline template (default `coding-pipeline-standard`) so the frontend stops hardcoding it. Response: `{pipeline, version, phases[{id, name, model_tier, task_type, depends_on, order}]}`. Frontend wrapper `listPhases()` in `lib/api.ts`; presentation-derivation utility `lib/phaseLabels.ts` with `derivePhaseDef()` + `STANDARD_PIPELINE_OVERRIDES` for the special labels ("1a", "1c · OPUS · cross-model gate"). `RunDetailClient.tsx` and `skills/page.tsx` now hydrate from the endpoint at mount with `FALLBACK_PHASES` for engine-offline / first-paint. 12 backend tests + functional probes for engine task_type detection + 404 path-traversal guard. Resolves DUPLICATES_REFRESHED.md NEW Group A (phase metadata duplicated across YAML + 2 TSX files).
- **Admin audit log + config-surface documentation** (#838) — new `admin_audit_log` table in `engine.db` records every successful `PUT /api/v1/admin/feature-flags` with the before/after JSON, the comma-separated list of keys that actually changed value, the source pid, and a timestamp. New `GET /api/v1/admin/audit-log?limit=&offset=` endpoint surfaces the rows newest-first (limit 1–1000, default 100). Audit appends are best-effort: a DB-write failure logs a warning but does not block the admin PUT. Hand-edits to `admin.json` are NOT audited (documented limitation). New `docs/CONFIG-SURFACE.md` documents every file under `~/.orchestration-engine/` (`engine.db`, `admin.json`, `tasks/`, `webhook-secret`, pid files) with writers/readers/sensitivity/audit-trail. 13 regression tests at `tests/test_admin_audit_log.py`.

### Changed
- **Consolidated `_VERDICT_KEYWORDS` into single source-of-truth** (#836) — `verdict_parser._VERDICT_KEYWORDS` (lowercase set) is the canonical definition. Removed the parallel uppercase tuple from `transitions.py:95`; `transitions` now re-exports the canonical set via `from .verdict_parser import _VERDICT_KEYWORDS`. Updated `sequencer.py:3363` to compare lowercase (was `.upper()` — would have silently missed all verdicts after the consolidation). 9 regression tests at `tests/test_verdict_keywords_consolidation.py` enforce two-hop single-definition invariant + functional case-coverage + in-place mutation propagation. Latent divergence risk eliminated.
- **`feature_flags` are now consumed at runtime** (#840) — new `src/orchestration_engine/feature_flags.py` module reads `~/.orchestration-engine/admin.json` with 30s TTL cache (path overridable via `ORCH_ADMIN_PATH`). Two of the four canonical flags are wired:
  - `phase0_hard_gate` (default `False`) — when `True` AND the `existing_symbols_inventory` phase exhausts retries, the engine OVERRIDES the YAML's `transitions.exhausted` (typically `spec` — graceful degradation) and HALTS the pipeline. Closes the #835 reservation: the flag is no longer documentation-only.
  - `dialogue_phase` (default `False`) — when `False`, any phase with `type: dialogue` in YAML is SKIPPED with a synthetic `state: skipped_by_feature_flag` result; the linear sequencer continues to the next phase. Set to `True` (admin console or direct `admin.json` edit) to actually run the cross-model dialogue loop.
  - `extend_verdict` and `cross_repo` remain admin-persisted but not yet runtime-consumed (prompt-level / not-yet-implemented respectively).
- 23 tests at `tests/test_feature_flags_runtime.py` (read + cache + defensive-fallback inc. `PermissionError` probe; defaults-match-admin-api drift guard both directions; sequencer source-wiring assertions for `PHASE_0_ID` constant + all 3 dialogue dispatch sites; functional override probe; ORCH_ADMIN_PATH split-brain guard; default-state probes). Updated `templates/coding-pipeline-standard.yaml` Phase 0 description + `transitions.exhausted` comment to point operators to the admin console for the hard-gate toggle (no longer "reserved/unimplemented").
- `ORCH_ADMIN_PATH` env var now honoured by BOTH the engine's runtime reader (`feature_flags.is_enabled`) AND the admin API's read/write handlers (`web/api.py` GET / PUT `/api/v1/admin/feature-flags` and `/api/v1/admin/state`). Eliminates split-brain where tests pointed the reader at a tmpdir while writes silently went to `~/.orchestration-engine/admin.json`.
- `PHASE_0_ID` constant in `feature_flags.py` is the single canonical phase id for Phase 0; the sequencer's hard-gate check now references `_ff.PHASE_0_ID` instead of a string literal. Drift between the constant and the YAML phase id would silently disable the hard gate, so the test suite anchors on the constant.
- Dialogue gate wired in ALL three sequencer dispatch sites — `_execute_wave_sequential` (linear), `_execute_wave_parallel` (parallel wave), and `StateMachineSequencer._execute_transitions` (transition-routed). A consumer cannot accidentally bypass the gate by choosing a different sequencer.
- Dialogue skip log level lowered from `WARNING` to `INFO` — default-disabled state is a clean exit per design, not an operator-attention event.

### Added
- **Phase 0 — Existing-symbols inventory** (#835) — `templates/coding-pipeline-standard.yaml` bumped to v2.1.0 (additive minor — no breaking change). Phase 0 (`existing_symbols_inventory`, sonnet/medium, max 2 iterations) runs BEFORE the spec phase and produces a sticky `{output_dir}/existing_symbols.md` artifact (UI primitives, project shared libs, adjacent action/hook patterns, workspace barrels). Ported from `orchemist-skills/pipelines/coding-pipeline-standard.yaml v4.2`.
- **Inventory-consumer prompts** (#835) — SPEC, BEHAVIORAL, SPEC_ADVERSARY, ACCEPTANCE_TEST, IMPLEMENT, REVIEW, and FIX prompts in `coding-pipeline-standard.yaml` now read `existing_symbols.md` and enforce the CONSUME / EXTEND / DIVERGENT / NEW-OK verdict discipline. Each prompt includes a backward-compat short-circuit: if the inventory file is absent OR its sections are all empty stubs, the phase falls back to ad-hoc grep against the standard targets (project UI primitive package(s), `lib/`/`utils/`, sibling files, workspace barrels). The sticky enforcement makes sub-check 7d (re-implementation of existing symbols) caught at SPEC stage and re-enforced at IMPLEMENT + REVIEW, rather than only at REVIEW.
- **Five new `config_schema` fields** for Phase 0 (#835): `ui_primitive_paths`, `lib_paths`, `action_dirs`, `workspace_barrels` (strings, default `""` — newline-separated globs), and `phase0_hard_gate` (boolean, default `false`). The first four are Phase 0 grep inputs; the fifth is a reserved-but-unimplemented forward-compat flag (no runtime effect today — see #840 for admin feature_flags runtime wiring; the actual halt-on-Phase-0-failure behaviour is controlled solely by `transitions.exhausted` on the phase, default `spec` = graceful degradation, override to `null` = halt).
- **`apply_config_schema_defaults()`** in `daemon.py` (#835, 19 tests: 13 unit + 2 helper-level integration + 1 source-grep guard + 1 Click `CliRunner` end-to-end + 2 defensive-schema) — fills missing optional keys in `initial_input` from `template.config_schema.properties.<key>.default` before the sequencer renders prompts. Prevents `<MISSING:fieldname>` literals in rendered prompts when an existing consumer's config dict pre-dates a newly-added optional config field. Existing keys are never overwritten. Called from THREE entry points: (1) the daemon (`orch launch` → daemon spawn), (2) the synchronous `orch run` command (`cli.py:run_template`), and (3) the scenario runner (`scenario_run`). The integration test loads the v2.1.0 standard pipeline YAML against a minimal pre-v2.1 input dict and asserts the rendered Phase 0 prompt has no `<MISSING:>` literal.

### Scope note (#835 deferred items)
- The engine YAML's spec_adversary retains the engine v2.0 baseline checks (specificity, trivial-satisfaction, edge-case, leakage, alignment) plus the new 7d inventory enforcement. The canonical skills v4.2 has five additional sub-checks (1a cross-layer identifier mapping, 1b stable diagnostic codes, 1c dev-mode instrumentation noise, 5a closed-union set-equality, 5b deferred-as-ok discipline) that this PR did NOT port — they are unrelated to Phase 0 and warrant their own scoped issue + review cycle.
- `test_command` default in `config_schema` is left at the engine's existing `"python3 -m pytest tests/ -x -q"`; the canonical v4.2 uses `""` with a language-conditional fallback description. Deferred — touching this default has language-cross-cutting consequences (polyglot test commands) that exceed Phase 0 scope.
- The `phase0_hard_gate` config flag remains a reserved no-op until #840 (admin feature_flags runtime wiring) lands. The description and inline comment honestly disclose this.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Dialogue phase** — engine-side cross-model drafter ↔ reviewer loop (#677, PR #808). `DialoguePhaseConfig`, `DialogueParticipant`, `DialogueRound`, `DialogueResult`, `DialogueRunner`, `run_dialogue()` in `dialogue_phase.py` (794 LOC, 18 tests). `GeminiCliExecutor` (`gemini -p` subprocess wrapper, 600 s default timeout) exposes a non-Anthropic reviewer family for the marquee trust-engine wedge. Example template at `templates/spec-review-dialogue.yaml`. Jaccard similarity > 0.95 between consecutive draft pairs surfaces `convergence_stall`. Per-round cost via `TaskResult.cost_usd` (no 3× fallback inflation). Verdict extraction reuses `verdict_parser.extract_verdict()` — anticipating the #687 consolidation. Sequencer dispatch is additive (+196 lines) — no refactor of existing dispatch.
- Directory-level hash guard with `protected_paths` (#706) — `compute_directory_hash()` in `file_guard.py` for recursive, deterministic SHA-256 over directories; pre-execution snapshot + post-execution verification detects unauthorized writes to repo paths like `tests/` or `src/`; excludes `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.git/` by default; symlinks hashed by target path string (not followed); path resolution: `config["repo_path"]` primary, `working_dir` fallback.
- Approve-gated file protection with `protect_on_approve` (#718) — adversary/reviewer phases can declare files to seal upon APPROVE verdict; hash snapshot taken at the approve transition (after verdict extraction), stored in `_protected_hashes` for downstream verification; activates on both `approve` and `exhausted` (implicit approval); `coding-pipeline-skip-spec.yaml` updated to guard `acceptance_tests.py` via `acceptance_test_adversary`.

### Changed
- **Consolidated verdict-extraction implementations** (#687, PR #820) — `verdict_parser.extract_verdict()` is the single canonical implementation. Deleted `review_parser.extract_verdict()` plus its private 4-layer cascade helpers (`_smart_full_text_scan`, `_tail_weighted_scan`, `_haiku_extraction`). Canonical output is lowercase (`"approve"`, `"request_changes"`, `"abort"`); `.upper()` boundary in `parse_review_output()` preserves the `ReviewResult.verdict` UPPERCASE contract for ~100 incidental callers in `audit.py`, `scoring.py`, `review_catch_value.py`, DB layer. `ABORT` filtered out at the boundary (`allowed_verdicts={"approve", "request_changes"}`) because the review phase prompt only emits APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES. Net -491 lines across `review_parser.py`, `tests/test_review_parser.py`, `daemon.py`.
- **Unified SHA-256 file-hash implementations** (#813, PR #818) — `file_guard.compute_hash()` is the single canonical implementation. Removed private `_compute_hash()` duplicates from `validator_runner.py` and `test_store.py`; both now import from `file_guard`. Behaviour byte-identical; sealed-manifest hashes unchanged. Net -30 lines.

### Fixed
- Removed `'crashed'` phantom status from frontend `RunStatus` literal union (#811, PR #821, frontend) — there is no `'crashed'` value on the engine side; previous mapping caused `RunStatusBadge` to silently fall through to neutral. Added the missing canonical statuses `'budget_exceeded'` (emitted by `daemon.py:696`) and `'pending_review'` (emitted by `daemon.py:876`, `daemon.py:1502`). `RunStatusBadge.statusToVariant` rewritten as exhaustive `Record<RunStatus, BadgeVariant>` lookup; unknown strings now render `error` (not neutral) and log a dev-only console warning.

### Internal — Harness web surface (frontend/, not packaged in PyPI distribution)
- New Orchemist Harness shell — Next.js operator surface with six cross-linked screens (Fleet Dashboard, Run Cockpit, Adversary Loop visualizer, Trust & Gates, Admin / Activation, Skills Pack Mode). Shared design system primitives under `frontend/components/harness/`. Live-engine wiring via `/api/v1/gates`, `/api/v1/runs` (#816, #819).
- Investigation pack `docs/harness-redesign-2026-05-24/` with vision synthesis, duplicate audit, frontend audit, autonomy posture, and SVG canon (#809).
- Playwright e2e suite at `frontend/tests-e2e/`: 6 mocked-offline tests + 6 live-engine tests; full-page screenshots checked in under `docs/harness-redesign-2026-05-24/screenshots/`.
