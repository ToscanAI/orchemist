# Changelog

All notable changes to Orchemist (formerly Orchestration Engine).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- JSON-RPC IPC protocol for orchestrator↔validator communication (#540)
- External validator subprocess with restricted permissions (#539)
- 3-phase spec loop v2.0 — spec → behavioral → adversary (#666) — restructured coding pipeline spec loop with adversarial review
- Incremental spec editing + postmortem phase (#663, #652) — spec edits applied incrementally; postmortem phase for failure analysis
- Git-based phase handoff for spec-loop iterations (#674) — phase outputs handed off via git commits for reliable iteration state
- Iteration-indexed file writing and `{iteration_history}` template variable (#649) — phases write output to iteration-specific files; history of prior iterations available via template variable
- `{iteration_history}` in all looping phase prompts (#650) — ensures all looping phases have full iteration context

### Fixed
- Fix git handoff committing chat summaries instead of agent-written files (#681)
- Fix `GitHandoff.finalize()` overwriting agent-written files with chat summaries (#679)
- Fix missing success fallback on verdict-routed phases causing early termination (#680)
- Fix verdict parser failing on markdown-formatted verdicts (#678)
- Fix `_detect_loop_groups()` including downstream phases in self-loop with success transition (#672)
- Fix `_detect_loop_partners()` only detecting 2-phase loops — 3-phase spec loop had empty iteration_history and stale file reads (#667)
- `MAX_ITERATIONS` error now distinguishes repeated vs new findings (#651) — clearer error messaging at iteration limit
- Spec agent syncs edits to both `spec.md` and `spec-behavioral.md` (#668) — prevents spec drift between files
- `DryRunExecutor` result now includes `text` key; skip required field validation in dry-run mode (#659)
- Updated webhook/trigger test template refs after legacy template removal (#659)
- Adversary phase skips re-raising resolved findings from prior rounds — prevents false regressions
- Success fallback transition added to `spec_adversary` in all coding templates (#645) — prevents stuck runs when adversary approves
- Strengthened spec revision discipline in coding pipeline template (#670) — spec agent follows stricter edit rules
